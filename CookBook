Raw data:     Raw datas are collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone and downloadable on
              https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 
              A full description of the data study is available at:

Tidy data:    Project assignment:   
              1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
              2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
              3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
              4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
              5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable 
                 for each activity and each subject.

Data structure:   The resulting tidy data is a data.frame AvXData with 68 variables stored in the github repository:
                  https://github.com/monika66/GetAndCleanData/blob/master/tidy_avXData.tx
                 
AvXData           data.frame 68 columns   

[1] "activity"    Factor w/ 6 levels
       Label describes activity of the measure
                  1 WALKING
                  2 WALKING_UPSTAIRS
                  3 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
                  4 SITTING
                  5 STANDING
                  6 LAYING

[2] "subject"     Integer 2
      Subjects are 30 anonym humans, for the observations named by integer numbers 
                  1 .. 30
                  
[3] .. [68]       numeric
       Column 3 - 68 contains the mean (average) of the "means or standard deviations variables measurement" grouped by activity and subject,
       The variable name parts includes informations about the original measurements, (more information see feature_info.txt):
          the first letter 't' to indicate time domain signals
          the first letter 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals
          mean():   Mean value 
          std():    Standard deviation
          Acc       3-axial raw signals by accelerometer 
          Gyro      3-axial raw signals by gyrometer 
          XYZ       X,Y or Z is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
          Jerk      the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals
          Mag       the magnitude of the three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm 
          Mean      the last name part "Mean" explains the average transformation done in this project assignment.
